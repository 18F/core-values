This is a statement of 18F core values that inform our culture and working
models. It is currently in **PRE-DRAFT** form.

This statement will reflect the shared values we wish to promote within 18F,
and the outcomes that we anticipate will result from the application of those
values. With this foundation in place, we will continue the discussion
regarding what percentage of our time we wish to set aside for activities that
contribute to those outcomes.

From that point, we may then reconsider adoption of the 18F Time policy, to
ensure that all 18F team members are empowered to exercise the privilege of
autonomous experimentation that aligns with core team values.

## Workshop
There will be an "18F Core Values Workshop" on Tuesday, April 21, 2015, from
3-5pm EDT, planned and facilitated by
[John Yuda](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/team/yuda/),
[Jeremy Canfield](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/team/jeremy/), and
[Jesse Taggert](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/team/jtag/) and
[Kate Garklavs](https://18f.gsa.gov/hub/team/kate/).

The goal of the workshop is to involve all interested 18F team members to
produce a more polished draft of this core values statement, to be ratified by
18F leadership and ultimately made public.

## Issues
Before the workshop, 18F team members should feel free to propose or discuss
any topics in advance via [the 18F/core-values GitHub
issues](https://github.com/18F/core-values/issues).
