## How we deliver services

We choose to work with partners who are willing to apply Agile development processes, as we believe they are often the best means to providing high-quality, long-lasting systems that meet actual user needs.

## How we operate

We seek to hire smart, talented people driven to create positive change. We empower them to address the needs of clients, of the 18F organization, and of the US government as a whole.

## How we act as individuals

We hold ourselves and one another accountable for demonstrating the impact of our chosen initiatives.

## How we interact with the public

We aim to do what's best for the public, whether that involves working on a product for a specific agency, tending to the long-term health of 18F as an organization, or providing assistance to other US government organizations.
