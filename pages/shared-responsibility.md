## How we deliver services

We design and deliver software in collaboration with agency stakeholders and the end users of the service.

## How we operate

We value each individual and work to provide an environment where each of us can do our best work. We hold people accountable to their commitments, but encourage risk taking and learning from failure.

## How we act as individuals

We support each other.

## How we interact with the public

We publish source code and other artifacts as Open Source, welcoming contributors and critics.
