title: Making Government Work Better
---
## How we deliver services

We deliver software services that improve government and make government work better for the public.  We measure the impact of our work, delivering iteratively so that we can ensure that our work acheives its desired outcome.

## How we operate

We have small autonomous teams that model effective patterns for government work.  We document our policies and blog about effective techniques that our federal colleagues can learn from.

## How we act as individuals

When we have to work-around an inefficiency in government, we communicate our "hack" and also escalate the "real" fix. We model best practices.

## How we interact with the public

We engage the public in co-creating the services that we are building for them. And model a modern-feeling government. Create services which cause people to have higher expectations of the US Government
