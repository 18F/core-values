## How we deliver services

We practice and promote Open Source, Open APIs, Open Data, and deliver to real users early.

## How we operate

Transparency involves making a good-faith effort to listen to input and feedback from the team, to let the team know that it was heard, and to communicate decisions and the reasoning that went into them. This doesnâ€™t pertain just to 18F leadership, but to each individual 18F team member and the team as a whole.

Anyone at 18F is welcome to give feedback and contribute to any project or initiative. We seek to present works-in-progress for feedback before finalizing policies or work products.

## How we act as individuals

We track our time, share documents and other project artifacts, and heavily use GitHub pull requests and issues.

## How we interact with the public

We are honest and open about our failures and challenges as well as our successes.
