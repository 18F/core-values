title: Vision and Mission
---

Our **vision** is our ultimate goal. When we succeed, how will the world be changed? _Where_ are we going?

This is distinct from our **mission**; _what_ we will need to do in order to get to that future world, or our [values](core-values/index.html): how we're going to do it.

## Problem statement

If we think the world must change, it means we have concluded something is broken.

Government does not work optimally because agencies are missing great:

* processes
* talent
* tools

# Vision

A Government that:

* responds to public needs, with public participation/engagement
* has great teams of technologists
* builds, or buys, great tools and services, more quickly, for less

# Mission

18F is a civic consultancy for the Government, inside the Government, working with Federal agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use, cost efficient, and reusable. 

We are transforming government from the inside out, creating **cultural change** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public. 

We are a **trusted partner** for agencies working to transform how they build and buy tools and services.

We will accomplish our mission by:

* putting the needs of the public first
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
* deploying tools and services early and often
* staying true to our [values](core-values/index.html)
