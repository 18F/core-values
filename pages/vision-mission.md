### Terms
**Vision** — What is the change that we want to see in the world? How is the world different if we succeed?

**Mission** — Our “North Star” that will guide us toward the vision / ultimate goal.

**Core Values** — Guiding principles that dictate behavior and action, enabling the team to deliver on the mission.

**Anti-Values** — Acknowledging situations that have a predictably bad outcome. 

### Problem statement

If we think the world must change, it means we have concluded something is broken.

Government does not work optimally because agencies are missing great:

* processes
* talent
* tools

## Vision

A Government that:

* responds to public needs, with public participation/engagement
* has great teams of technologists
* builds or buys great tools and services, more quickly, for less

## Mission

18F is a civic consultancy _for_ the Government, _inside_ the Government, working with agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use, cost efficient, and reusable. 

We are transforming government from the inside out, creating **cultural change** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public. 

We are a **trusted partner** for agencies working to transform how they build and buy tools and services in a user-centered way.

We will accomplish our mission by:

* putting the needs of the public first
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven
* deploying tools and services early and often

## Core Values
(Our [values](core-values/index.html) are being drafted [here](https://github.com/18F/core-values/tree/18f-pages/pages).)
* [Making Government Work Better](core-values/making-government-work-better/)
* [Transparency](core-values/transparency/)
* [Integrity](core-values/integrity/)
* [Shared Responsibility](core-values/shared-responsibility/)
* [Shipping](core-values/shipping/)
* [Autonomy](core-values/autonomy/)
