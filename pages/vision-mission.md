title: Vision and Mission

### Terms
**Vision** — What is the change that we want to see in the world? How is the world different if we succeed?

**Mission** — Our “North Star” that will guide us toward the vision / ultimate goal.

**Core Values** — Guiding principles that dictate behavior and action, enabling the team to deliver on the mission.

**What we're not** — Acknowledging roles that have a predictably bad outcome. 

### Problem statement

If we think the world must change, it means we have concluded something is broken.

Government does not work optimally because agencies are missing great:

* processes
* talent
* tools

## Vision

A Government that:

* responds to public needs, with public participation and engagement;
* has great teams of technologists;
* builds or buys excellent tools and services, more quickly, for less.

## Mission

18F is a civic consultancy _for_ the Government, _inside_ the Government, enabling agencies to rapidly deploy tools and services that are easy to use, cost efficient, and reusable. 

We are transforming government from the inside out, creating **cultural change** by working with teams inside agencies who want to create great services for the public. 

We are a **trusted partner** for agencies working to transform how they manage and deliver services to the public.

We will accomplish our mission by:

* putting the needs of the public first;
* being design-centric, agile, open, and data-driven;
* deploying tools and services early and often.

## Core Values [DRAFT]
_Our [values](core-values/index.html) are a result of the all-team Core Values Workshop, April 22, 2015. [Contribute and edit!](https://github.com/18F/core-values/tree/18f-pages/pages)_
* [Making Government Work Better](core-values/making-government-work-better/)
* [Transparency](core-values/transparency/)
* [Integrity](core-values/integrity/)
* [Shared Responsibility](core-values/shared-responsibility/)
* [Shipping](core-values/shipping/)
* [Autonomy](core-values/autonomy/)

## “What we're not” [DRAFT]
In order to deliver on our mission, it is important to acknowledge the following truths.

**We are not...**

* a body shop (one-off requests that are not product focused) or an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) shop
* able to tolerate an end-run around our intake process, no matter the stakeholder
* [COTS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf) implementors (but we will re-sell and add value to COTS!)
* interested in projects that simply redesign a website
* GSA’s internal digital service team (coming soon!)
* GSA CIO's or the Federal Acquisition Service
* a fire-fighting / rescue squad
* a helpdesk / free advice
* a contractor
